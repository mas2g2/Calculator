# This is a Calculator

This is my first project that I publish in C#.
 In this Calculator the user performs calculations by first presing any
of the digits in the key pad. When the user clicks a button for the operation the user wishes to perform the number will be stored for the calculation that will be performed when the user clicks the equal button. It is highly recomended in clicking the equal button for seeing the result of the calculation. 

For viewing the implementation code for this calculator view the code in file Form1.cs. 

For viewing the Design of the Form click Form1.Designer.cs
